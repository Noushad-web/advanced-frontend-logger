# advanced-frontend-logger
An advanced, flexible, and extensible logging library for frontend JavaScript applications. This custom logger is designed to replace the standard console methods, providing a more powerful and configurable solution to enhance your application's logging strategy.

## Features

- **Log Level Control**: Manage and filter logs based on severity levels (`debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`).
- **Consistent and Informative Formatting**:
  - **Timestamps**: Option to include timestamps in logs, either in human-readable format or ISO string.
  - **Caller Information**: Automatically capture and display the function name, file path, and line number where the log was called.
  - **Color Coding**: Enable colored log levels for easier distinction in the console.
- **Environment-Based Logging**: Automatically disable or adjust logging in production environments to improve performance and security.
- **Multiple Transports Support**: Extend logging capabilities by adding custom transports to send logs to various destinations (e.g., remote servers, local storage).
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Non-blocking log queue ensures that logging doesn't hinder your application's performance.
- **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures a single, consistent logger instance throughout your application.
- **Extensible Configuration**: Easily customize logger settings to suit your project's needs.
